CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1840 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

RBOR-1#1 Warning
RAMB output registers  
RAMB dmem_inst/RAM_reg output DOA (18) DOB (14) is connected to asynchronous registers, if you use synchronous controls you will get better results both in area and delay (RAMB has synchronous registers built in).
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 dmem_inst/RAM_reg has an input control pin dmem_inst/RAM_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: dmem_inst/Q[6]) which is driven by a register (arm_inst/dp/aluresreg/q_reg[8]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
